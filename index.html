<h2>Agenda # 1. Create a Repository</h2>

<p>A <strong>repository</strong> is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a <em>README</em>, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. <em>It also offers other common options such as a license file.</em></p>
